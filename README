Lists your favourite folders in a menu for quick access.

You can create a single level hierarchy by tagging top level folders like this : ===name===
So, for example :

===Home=== /home/nick/
downloads /home/nick/downloads
music /home/nick/music
bin /home/nick/bin
===Computer=== /
bin /bin

This way, you can have two "bin" folder favourites.
