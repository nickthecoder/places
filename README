Places gnome shell extension by Nick Robinson
(License: GPL v3)

Lists favourite folders and files in a menu for quick access.

Out of the box, it will only list the Gnome favourite Places, however it can do more than that!
It can list many sets of favourite places, with each set in its own sub-menu.

To create your own sets of places, create a folder :

    mkdir -p ~/.config/ntc-places
    
Now create as many text files in there, each containing the paths to folders and files.
The name of the text file is used within the menu.

If you want to use the standard Gnome favourite Places, then link to it like so :

    ln -s ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks ~/.config/ntc-places/Gnome\ Places
